            A ToUse dependency is a dependency that must be produced before this node is used/consumed/ran by something else. If we are able to retrieve this node from the cache server
            we will also build its to-use dependencies before building any node that uses this node. One example of a ToUse dependencies is a dll distributed next to an executable.

             A class to that can represent one or more files. Its purpose is to allow globs (like Runtime/**/*.cpp), to not be immediately flattened into the resulting cpp files,
             but for us to be able to continue to persist the knowledge of that glob throughout the pipeline, so that later we can still use this information. Project file generation
             is a usecase that wants to know the original globs, as it allows to create project files that are more robust against changes-on-disk, since they won't have to be regenerated
             when a new .cpp file gets added, since when they use globs, that won't change the contents of the project file itself. This also allows the buildprogram to avoid executing
             the actual glob when it's producing the project file, which in turn means that the tundra buildgraph for the project files will have fewer GlobSignatures, so there will be a higher
             % of builds that we can satisfy by doing completely nothing, isntead of having to run the buildprogram to realize we have to do nothing.
            
             In most usages of OneOrMoreFiles,  you can just implicitely assign an NPath and don't worry about anything.

            <summary>
            Retrieves a list of all files in this artifact. Beware a number of
            issues with this extension to the core Stevedore system:
            - If the file list isn't already cached, it will be downloaded in
              the frontend, which happens synchronously on a single thread
              (like everything in the frontend). Using a lot of file lists
              can thus have a significant performance impact in poor network
              conditions (10 seconds per file list in the worst case).
            - These frontend downloads may encounter SSL certificate issues on
              certain .NET runtime and OS combinations (these issues do not
              occur for regular downloads in the backend).
            - Error handling is less polished in the frontend, and there's no
              telemetry data, which may make troubleshooting more difficult.
            - '.filelist' artifacts are not checksummed, and therefore carry an
              increased risk of file corruption on disk or in transit.

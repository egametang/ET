ASTAR_NO_ZIP                         ; Enable to strip out usage of the DotNetZip library. Increases serialized data size, but this is only relevant if you are using cached startup or loading serialized graphs during runtime. You can delete the Pathfinding.Ionic.Zip.Reduced dll after you have enabled this. You will have to reconfigure all graph settings after enabling.
ASTAR_FAST_NO_EXCEPTIONS             ; Needs to be enabled for the iPhone build setting Fast But No Exceptions to work.
ASTAR_GRID_NO_CUSTOM_CONNECTIONS     ; Disabling this will reduce memory usage and improve performance slightly but you will not be able to add custom connections to grid nodes using e.g the NodeLink component.
ASTAR_LEVELGRIDNODE_FEW_LAYERS       ; Reduces the max number of layers for LayeredGridGraphs from 255 to 16. Saves memory.
ASTAR_NO_PENALTY                     ; Enabling this disables the use of penalties. Reduces memory usage.
ASTAR_NO_POOLING                     ; Disable pooling for some reason. Could be debugging or just for measuring the difference.
ASTAR_NoGUI                          ; Disables the use of the OnGUI function, can possibly improve performance by a tiny bit (disables the InGame option for path debugging).
ASTAR_POOL_DEBUG                     ; Enables debugging of path pooling. Will log warnings and info messages about paths not beeing pooled correctly.
ASTAR_RECAST_CLASS_BASED_LINKED_LIST ; Disables the array based linked list. This might handle very large tiles better, however it is usually slower to scan and uses more memory (during scanning).
ASTAR_RECAST_BFS                     ; Enables an experimental optimization to recast. Faster scanning and updating but can sometimes fail to generate any navmesh at all (this is relatively rare though).
ASTAR_RECAST_LARGER_TILES            ; Raises the vertex count limit on recast tiles, but reduces the max number of tiles.
ASTAR_SET_LEVELGRIDNODE_HEIGHT       ; Enables a field height for each node if you want to use that information. Not used by any included scripts. Warning: Will break node serialization (for e.g cached startup) if changed.
ProfileAstar                         ; Enables profiling of the pathfinding process.
ASTAR_UNITY_PRO_PROFILER             ; Requires ProfileAstar, profiles section of astar code which will show up in the Unity Pro Profiler.
ASTAR_JPS                            ; Enables jump point search support for grid graphs. There is a separate toggle in the grid graph settings. Disable this if you do not use it since it reduces memory usage.

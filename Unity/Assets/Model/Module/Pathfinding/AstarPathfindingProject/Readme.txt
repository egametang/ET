========= The A* Pathfinding Project =========

The A* Pathfinding Project is an out-of-the-box pathfinding system
which along with ease of use has a large amount of features and blazing fast pathfinding.

The system has a Free version and a Pro version, both can found on my website (see below) and the Pro version can also be found in the Unity Asset Store
	
Documentation for the system can be found at:
	http://www.arongranberg.com/astar/docs/

A Get Started Guide can be found here:
